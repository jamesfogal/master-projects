## Current Production State
Date Added:    2026-07-04 00:00:00 UTC
Last Modified: 2026-07-04 00:00:00 UTC

- Site: https://pingclose.com
- Status: PARTIALLY BROKEN
- Email verification is broken for ALL non-VIP visitors
- Root cause: RESEND_API_KEY has BOM (U+FEFF) at character index 7
- Every /api/send-code call returns 500 "Failed to send code. Please try again."
- Broken since deployment: dpl_EiKHaD9tMRxmoNVmFcX3EbG7WVZ9
- Last known good email verifications: June 12 and June 19 (prior deployment)
- PageSpeed agent: working, 90s cap, 75s AbortController
- Polling: working, 90s hard stop
- Report page: redesigned (Emil Kowalski / Linear aesthetic)
- Vercel project: prj_ype7bc4ehRWej1NLN6Y3l6LrzUrg
- Supabase project: xvrhxtnhmnurvxitnijy

## Current Architecture
Date Added:    2026-07-04 00:00:00 UTC
Last Modified: 2026-07-04 00:00:00 UTC

- Framework: Next.js App Router
- Hosting: Vercel
- Database: Supabase (shared with localseoaeopro project)
- Email: Resend (BROKEN — BOM in API key)
- PageSpeed: Google PageSpeed Insights API
- Background work: Next.js after() — fires pagespeed-agent post-response

Key files:
- app/HomeClient.tsx — email verification gate (form → verifying → verified)
- app/api/send-code/route.ts — generates 6-digit code, sends via Resend
- app/api/verify-code/route.ts — validates 6-digit code
- app/api/audit/route.ts — main audit orchestrator
- app/api/pagespeed-agent/route.ts — PageSpeed agent (maxDuration: 90)
- app/check/page.tsx — polling page with 90s hard stop
- app/report/[id]/page.tsx — redesigned report page
- lib/agents/ — 8 audit agents
- vercel.json — all routes capped at 90s

## Fixed Issues
Date Added:    2026-07-04 00:00:00 UTC
Last Modified: 2026-07-04 00:00:00 UTC

- [2026-07-03] Check page blinking — polling now detects DB status change (commit 5b49c0a)
- [2026-07-03] PageSpeed agent killed at 60s — export const maxDuration = 90 added (commit b61e313, e825fdd)
- [2026-07-03] vercel.json glob conflict — unified all routes to 90s
- [2026-07-03] Infinite polling loop — 90s hard stop with TIMEOUT fallback (commit ed18a07)
- [2026-07-03] Report page redesign — Linear/Vercel/Raycast aesthetic (commit 35459df)

## Open Issues
Date Added:    2026-07-04 00:00:00 UTC
Last Modified: 2026-07-04 00:00:00 UTC

- [CRITICAL] RESEND_API_KEY BOM — all email verification broken — fix: delete and repaste key in Vercel
- [HIGH] No health monitoring — no system watches whether PingClose itself is functioning
- [HIGH] VIP_EMAILS hardcoded list — Jim cannot test email flow from his own machine
- [MEDIUM] Email sends before PageSpeed completes — customer gets incomplete report link
- [DEFERRED] SuperAgent / health monitoring architecture — awaiting ChatGPT review

## Rules Learned
Date Added:    2026-07-04 00:00:00 UTC
Last Modified: 2026-07-04 00:00:00 UTC

- Never paste API keys from Notes, email, or any app that may add BOM characters
- Always paste keys directly from the source (resend.com, etc.)
- export const maxDuration in route file is authoritative — vercel.json globs do not override it
- VIP bypass lists prevent the developer from testing real user flows
- Every infrastructure failure must be caught by automated health checks, not real users

## Important Decisions
Date Added:    2026-07-04 00:00:00 UTC
Last Modified: 2026-07-04 00:00:00 UTC

- [2026-07-03] Agreed: pagespeed AbortController at 75s, Vercel cap at 90s (15s cushion)
- [2026-07-03] Agreed: polling hard stop at 30 polls = 90s then TIMEOUT state
- [2026-07-03] Decided: build healthAgent system after Resend key is fixed
- [2026-07-03] Decided: SuperAgent architecture to be reviewed with ChatGPT before implementation
- [2026-07-03] Decided: Master Brain system to be permanent source of truth across all projects
- [2026-07-04] Decided: Self-Healing Agent Architecture — PingClose broken into contained agents over time. Each fragile external service lives inside its own agent. Future Repair Agent diagnoses failures, retries/repairs known issues, escalates anything requiring Jim approval. DEFERRED until Sunday 2026-07-06.
- [2026-07-04] Next session directive: Review all open PingClose tasks, knock them out one at a time, starting with highest business-impact issue.

- ed18a07 | 2026-07-03 | Add 90s hard stop to PageSpeed polling — never runs forever

- b61e313 | 2026-07-03 | Fix pagespeed-agent maxDuration — set 300s via route export
- 35459df | 2026-07-03 | Redesign report page — Linear/Vercel visual treatment
- 5b49c0a | 2026-07-03 | Poll Supabase for PageSpeed completion — stop blinking when done

## Things Never To Forget
Date Added:    2026-07-04 00:00:00 UTC
Last Modified: 2026-07-04 00:00:00 UTC

1. RESEND_API_KEY must be deleted and repasted clean in Vercel — BOM is invisible, you cannot see it
2. Jim's emails bypass all verification — he has never seen the real user email flow
3. Mark Mattieu tried twice (mark@memfilms.com, mmattei89@gmail.com) on 2026-07-03 — both failed
4. The email verification feature DID work on June 12 and June 19 on a prior deployment
5. No health monitoring exists — every failure is discovered by real users, not automated checks
6. export const maxDuration = 90 in the route file is the only reliable way to set Vercel function duration
7. Supabase is shared between PingClose and LocalSEOAEOPro — never split without explicit approval
8. Master Brain files are the permanent source of truth — not chat history

## 2026-07-07 — MONSTER Migration Routing (Session VIKTOR-2026-07-07-S001)
Date Added: 2026-07-07 01:10:00 UTC | Last Modified: 2026-07-07 01:10:00 UTC

- 20 knowledge object(s) routed into MASTER_BRAIN.md (word-for-word, append-only) from the JUNE16 pilot and the 2026-07-07 decomposition of WHY_WE_BUILT_IT_THIS_WAY.md and JUNE22/JUNE25/JUNE28 session records.
- Originals preserved; archive: C:\Projects reference copy in MONSTER_MASTER_BRAIN_ARCHIVE (Viktor workspace) with ARCHIVE_INDEX.md.
- Stale items flagged during migration: DNS switch to Vercel COMPLETED 2026-06-25 (TODO.md reconciled); 'Websiteon' H1 typo claim verified FALSE 2026-06-22; Twilio fully removed 2026-06-25; PAGESPEED_API_KEY 'returning zeros' likely resolved by 2026-06-25 PageSpeed Agent rebuild — pending live re-verification.
